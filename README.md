# DataTables-Processing-Template
Description:

A tool for integrating DataTables with both server-side and client-side processing in your web projects. This project is part of a larger portfolio available for public use and contributions. Access all projects from a single location.

Features:

Server-Side Processing: Efficiently handle large datasets by delegating paging, searching, and ordering operations to the server. Each interaction with the DataTable triggers an Ajax request to fetch the required data.
Client-Side Processing: Manage smaller datasets directly in the browser, reducing server load and simplifying implementation.
Flexible Templates: Includes customizable templates for both server-side and client-side processing, allowing for easy adaptation to various data handling needs.
Optimized Performance: Designed to handle large volumes of data with minimal performance impact.
