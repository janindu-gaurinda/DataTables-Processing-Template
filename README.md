# DataTables-Processing-Template

Description:
DataTablesProcessingTemplate provides a comprehensive setup for implementing DataTables with both server-side and client-side processing. This project offers templates and examples for efficiently handling large datasets by leveraging server-side processing, where all data manipulations are performed on the server, ensuring optimal performance and scalability. The project also includes client-side processing examples for handling smaller datasets directly in the browser.

Features:

Server-Side Processing: Efficiently handle large datasets by offloading data operations (paging, searching, ordering) to the server. Each interaction with the DataTable triggers an Ajax request to fetch the required data from the server.
Client-Side Processing: Manage smaller datasets directly in the browser, reducing server load and simplifying implementation.
Flexible Templates: Customizable templates for both server-side and client-side processing, allowing you to adapt the code to your specific needs.
Optimized Performance: Designed to handle large volumes of data with minimal performance impact.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DataTables.
Familiarity with server-side technologies and SQL.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/janindu-gaurinda
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd DataTablesProcessingTemplate
Usage
Server-Side Processing:

Configure the server-side script to handle requests from DataTables.
Modify server-side.php or the corresponding script to connect to your database and process requests.
Client-Side Processing:

Use the client-side.html template to initialize DataTables with client-side processing.
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view and interact with the DataTables examples.

Customization
Server-Side Script: Update the server-side script to match your database schema and processing requirements.
Client-Side Data: Adjust the client-side template to handle the data format and interactions needed for your application.
